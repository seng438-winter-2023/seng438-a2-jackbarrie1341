# 1 Introduction

This assignment required us to work as a team in writing tests for different methods that we were given. In this lab, we were able to successfully learn and practice basic unit testing using JUnit, which we had come across but only theoretically in previous courses. We have also been able to work with mock objects in testing code with various requirements.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Tammie - Range : getLowerBound() and getUpperBound()
- all tests for getLowerBound() successfully run with no errors or failures.
- tests for getUpperBound() runs with no errors but all failures (due to wrong source code).

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We had 10 tests to work on between 4 members: 5 from Range and 5 from DataUtilities so we decided to divide the work load between group members in two's, while two members volunteered to do three; so the final distribution was 3-3-2-2, corresponding to Dyenaan-Jack-Esohe-Tammie. Dyenaan worked on three tests from DataUtilities, Jack worked on three tests from Range, Esohe worked on the remaining two tests from DataUtilities and Tammie worked on two tests from Range.

Regardless of the fact that we split the tests as such, in order to ensure that every member has an all-round understanding of the assignment, we met up and went over each other's tests in detail.
